# Comment Parser
To run the custom comment parser and store the data in `todo_new.json`, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Parth0248/CommentParser
    cd CommentParser/Todomanager
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. Open the `cust-todo-parser.js` file and make any necessary modifications.

5. Run the custom comment parser using the following command:
    ```
    npm run parse-comments
    ```

    This will execute the `cust-todo-parser.js` script and generate the `todo_new.json` file. This command is executed even when the source code is built or run using npm commands.
