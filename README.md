# Comment Parser

To run the custom comment parser and store the data in `todo_new.json`, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Parth0248/Comment-Manager.git
   cd Comment-Manager
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. npm `run extract "path_to_source_code"` this will extract all comments from source and log it to console for now.
